TTIC 31020 Statistical Machine Learning

This repository contains my homework submissions to the problem sets for the [Statistical Machine Learning](http://www.ttic.edu/courses/) class I took at [TTIC](http://www.ttic.edu) while a [Graduate Student](https://capp.uchicago.edu/) at the University of Chicago.

This repository serves as as a contribution to my portfolio in the realm of Machine Learning.
